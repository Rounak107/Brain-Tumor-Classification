# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This Project involves a comprehensive demonstration of Brain Tumor Classification  utilizing Python, TensorFlow and OpenCV. It introduces a web application designed for  categorizing images based on Yes and No images of a Brain Tumor. Various image  classification, emphasizing the user interface interactions for image uploading and  prediction.

This is an introduction on Brain Tumor image classification using deep learning where the 
Technologies used such as Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV are highlighted asthe 
tools utilized in the classification process. A brief overview of the demonstration, 
emphasizing the use of a web app for the classification task.
The demo unfolds with the presentation of a web app designed for Brain Tumor 
classification using deep learning techniques. The process of uploading an image and 
classifying it as either having or not having a Brain Tumor is showcased. Multiple 
instances are demonstrated, illustrating user interaction with the app and the resulting 
classifications.
